# Demystifying the degree apprenticeship and why it's such a great deal

> TL;DR - this three year course pays a salary as we study towards a sponsored degree, spending half the time on built-in work placements

Many apprenticeships will have you working four days a week and studying for one. But, this apprenticeship works in blocks of three months. We spend three months at uni, then three months on placement, and repeat. The stuff we learn at uni could already be put into practise within a couple weeks. People learn in different ways - but for me, practical experience really helps solidify my understanding of something.

### The new kids

Our first couple weeks covered all the induction stuff. It was pretty intense, not gonna lie, as we spent our first week with about 30 other newbies taking in all this new information. We had talks from lots of people, including presenters in the BBC which was cool. This first week was in Birmingham, in the Mailbox, while the second week was a bit more chilled up in Media City.

### Focus on freedom

One thing really stood out to me from the induction. That was, so many people would tell us that <StandoutText>once you're in the BBC, you can go anywhere.</StandoutText>

That is potentially one of the most exciting things about the scheme - look at how many presenters started off as runners, making the teas and all that. The BBC has a bit of everything, meaning if you want to learn about something - there'll be someone for you to chat to. This is a unique corporation, and I feel inspired to tap into to all it has to offer. Who knows where it might lead.

### What do we do at uni?

The degree packs in all sorts of computer science, maths and physics theory but also allows time for more creative, hands-on modules where we get to play with studio equipment and video production.

### Open to everybody

A majority of my cohort started the apprenticeship straight after A-Levels, at 18. But, it's not always the case as some were in their early twenties to start with. As far as gender split goes - it's basically 50/50: 7 boys and 6 girls. There is no typically right or wrong person for the apprenticeship.
