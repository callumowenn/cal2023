# Here's just some of my many highlights from working at CNN

> This article focuses on my time at CNN - I've made a similar list for my time at BBC which you can check out [here](/bbc/best-bits-so-far).

### The first stand-up

So, here I was. The first day. Who knew what other surprises I'd face after already [having to wear hi-vis on the way in](/cnn/a-new-home). After being introduced to a few members of the team, we all gathered around the trendy kitchen area for the morning's stand-up - the first of two daily meetings where everyone can come together as [the studio build](/cnn/a-new-home) progresses.

As I look around at all these new faces, I start to appreciate the size of the project. Professionals in their respective areas, each person seemed to bring a determined yet friendly energy. A mix of accents would fly across the space as we each introduced ourselves. There must've been about thirty names to learn, and it's harder when there were always new people flying in or out each week. Once introductions were done, we got to business.

I choose this moment because it was where I first realised the magnitude of this opportunity I'd been given. No way did I expect to be in such an exciting environment, with all these incredible people surrounding me. But, nevertheless, I was there. Ready to help bring a brand-new bureau come to life.

### Pizza delivery duty

This is a fun one. After just going live from Old Street for the first time, JJ thought everyone deserved pizza. So, a group of us would head down to [Pizza Union](https://www.pizzaunion.com/) to pick them up and make everyone's day back at the bureau. Lovely stuff.
