# Tired of flicking through streaming services trying to find that one show?

[WatchWhere](https://watchwhere.web.app "Go to WatchWhere") is the simple streaming service search engine. Have you ever struggled to find a show and had to resort to Googling "where to watch..."?

### <StandoutText>Not a fun time, is it?</StandoutText>

I got the idea for WatchWhere while on my second placement with [CNN](/cnn "Read about my time at CNN"), after being asked to check out Node.js. By this point, I had already been into web development for a decent amount of time and was familiar with Node.js. With the confidence that came from that, I had no hesitation in jumping right into a project - excited to see what I could make. Although I'd heard of Node.js, I hadn't thought of a good project allowing me to try it out. But, this little push from JJ - my manager while with CNN - would get me thinking. I wanted to find an API with actually useful or interesting data I could play with, which led me to [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com "Go to RapidAPI").

### Whoa, that's a lot of APIs.

There were a lot of APIs. Seeing as I was with CNN, I wanted to check out if there were any TV or film APIs to integrate. I found two: [Utelly](https://www.utelly.com "Go to Utelly") and [uNoGS - Unofficial Netflix Online Global Search](https://unogs.com "Go to uNoGS"). Utelly was great because it pulled in data from all sorts of streaming services:

-   Netflix
-   Amazon Prime
-   Disney+
-   Apple TV
-   YouTube

and also pulled data from online video stores:

-   Google Play Store
-   iTunes Store
-   Amazon Prime Store

All that data <StandoutText>for free?</StandoutText> No complaints. What's even better - and I didn't realise this until deep in development - is that each show also comes with a link to it's [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com "Go to IMDB") page. That's pretty sick - WatchWhere can tell you where to watch a show, and you can go to IMDB right from the app and read reviews etc. <StandoutText>Pretty cool.</StandoutText>

### How did I design it?

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
