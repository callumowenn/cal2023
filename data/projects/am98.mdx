# The web never ceases to amaze - with one library, I was able to create an interactive 3D experience straight in the browser

It was little things like this that really got me into web development. The capabilities of the web really are crazy, and it continues to develop. There isn't too much to say on this project - but it was so fun to make. If you find these 3D apps cool, definitely [check out the three.js site](https://threejs.org/) for all sorts of 3D nerdiness.

### Why floating shoes?

Why not?

Shout out to [this guy on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/skoda1by) for making and sharing the [3D render of an Air Max 98](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/nike-air-max-98-8bb6e7930a9a4c8687664cf3c0f112ae).
