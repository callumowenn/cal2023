# A playful, user-focused solution to help young people easily access apprenticeships

> You can read about my apprenticeship with the BBC _[here](/bbc)_

Pretty bold claims, I know, but this is something that really resonates with me. Sparking from a coursemate's idea of [starting a podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeXJwS1pMeH9sI6Mi_Sc7tQ "Check out the Lightbulb YouTube channel"), and my nerdy affection for web development, I was motivated to tackle the colossal project of building an all-in-one platform for everything apprenticeships. This is still clearly a work-in-progress, but the idea and intention is there to really make an impact. Throughout the design, I'd find myself referring back to well-known, user-friendly platforms like [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ "Go to Patreon"), [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk "Go to Airbnb") and [Bark](https://www.bark.com "Go to Bark") to name a few. The key with these platforms is that all the content is user-generated. The role of the platform is relatively simple, in that they literally provide a platform for users to interact and make transactions.

Imagine you're about to finish school or college - when it comes to 'next steps', university is always the main talking point. Get to seventeen, and suddenly your teacher sits you in front of a computer with the [UCAS](https://www.ucas.com/ "Go to UCAS") site ready for you to apply. Lightbulb aims to do many things, but ensuring the representation of apprenticeships and helping young people easily explore them is the overarching intention. <StandoutText>What if,</StandoutText> alongside UCAS, students were given a site like Lightbulb to scroll through? Who knows, but I'd like to think it would help them realise the endless opportunities that are out there. At the very least, I'd just hope they thought the site was cool.

### Keeping things nice and simple

As soon as I spoke about the platform with my coursemates, ideas began to spiral uncontrollably - <StandoutText>it was amazing.</StandoutText> We'd obviously all been through the apprenticeship hunt; it was as if each of us had already thought of multiple ways to make it easier. We thought of ways to help people who didn't know what they want to do, like implementing those psychometric quizzes and games or just simple questionnaires. We thought about how we could use push notifications and emails to remind users when an apprenticeship's applications are closing soon, or when a new one pops up. We even thought about how we could encompass the entire application process in one place: from initial application, to video interview, to assessment centre. What if all that was integrated in your calendar so you can stay organised? The list goes on.

### Designing to capture the excitement of a new career

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
